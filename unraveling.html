    <p>Written sometime in 2019.</p>
    <p>
        This poem is about healing old wounds, through peeling back the layers and "going through the jungle," so to speak. There was much more to this poem &mdash; anger, spitefulness, and despair directed at people I cared about &mdash; but those feelings come and go. The first stanza always resonates. This one's about learning to self-regulate while unpacking trauma.

        I experienced a lot of emotional flashbacks in 2019-2020 due to the aftermath of an abusive relationship, and reading this poem is like a recalibration exercise which helps me separate myself from someone else's actions. To anyone reading this: you did not "let" bad things happen to you. My current partner told me that a good person, despite being given the choice to do something bad, will choose the good. So simple and obvious.

         Trust your gut and stick to your morals. Seek trauma-informed therapy. Call a bitch out when you need to.

    <h2>The Unraveling</h2>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Slowly undo the sadness, not to overwhelm the senses.</p>
    <p>Comb your fingers over every wound,</p>
    <p>remembering where each came from &mdash;</p>
    <p>Every lie, betrayal, and cutting word whittled into you.</p>
    <p>Understand they hurt because they hurt,</p>
    <p>from a place of desperation</p>
    <p>and reasons beyond your comprehension.</p>
    <p>Let love and grace fill the empty spaces,</p>
    <p>Then feel that heaving in your chest steady</p>
    <p>to a shaky breath &mdash;</p>
<p><br></p>
