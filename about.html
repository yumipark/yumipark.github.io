    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        2nd gen Korean-American from Los Angeles, transplanted somewhere with all four seasons.
    </p>
    <br>
    <u><h2>EDUCATION & CAREER</h2></u>
    <p>
        I got my BA in philosophy (which I'm still paying off loans for) and ended up in the tech field.
    </p>
    <p>
        I ended up moving to a city I fell in love with, went to a web development bootcamp (incurred more debt but also met some lifelong friends), interned at a web dev agency, and also did some work as a mobile UI/UX designer for a crypto wallet and exchange.
    </p>
    <br>
    <u><h2>CURRENTLY</h2></u>
    <p>
        Found my passion for security, moved to a different part of the world, and dreaming of homesteading.
