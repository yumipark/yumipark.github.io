    <h1>The Unraveling</h1>
    <p>[ Written in 2019 ]</p>
    <p><em>When I was 23, I was in a particularly bad relationship. This poem is about acknowledging and processing the trauma, and forgiving myself for my role in it.</em></p> 
    
    <p><em>I am content and happy now, and every day feels like a blessing. However, the effects linger and I come back to this poem sometimes. Yoga has really helped me, and I am starting tantric yoga to help release sexual trauma.</em></p>

    <p>Slowly undo the sadness, not to overwhelm the senses.</p>
    <p>Comb your fingers over every wound,</p>
    <p>Remembering where each came from &mdash;</p>
    <p>Every lie, betrayal, and cutting word whittled into you.</p>
    <p>Understand they hurt because they hurt,</p>
    <p>from a place of desperation</p>
    <p>and reasons beyond your comprehension.</p>
    <p>Let love and grace fill the empty spaces,</p>
    <p>Then feel that heaving in your chest steady</p>
<p>to a shaky breath &mdash;</p>

    <h2>QUOTES FOR PEOPLE IGNORING THEIR GUT FEELINGS</h2>
    <p><em>Love and abuse cannot coexist.</em></p>
    <p><em>To be empathetic is to see things realistically in a loving light. It's not letting abuse and harmful behaviors slide.</em></p>
    <p><em>I very aggressively want all girls to get out of unhealthy relationships with manipulative boys who make you think what they’re doing is totally normal and okay when it’s not.</em></p>
    <p><em>A lot of people who have been in abusive relationships develop complex PTSD. The effects of trauma lingers. It also affects your loved ones and your physiology. Is this really the kind of life and relationship you wish to have?</em></p>
    <p><em>Too many young girls don’t know how to act when someone’s being inappropriate with them. They giggle or they try to brush it off. Don’t do that. Tell them to go fuck themselves - be a bitch. If someone’s being disrespectful to you, be disrespectful right back. Show them the same amount of respect that they show you.</em></p>
    <p><em>Sustained grief is particularly disturbing in a culture that offers a quick fix for pain. Sometimes it amazes me to know intuitively that the grieving are all around us yet we do not see any overt signs of their anguished spirits. We are taught to feel shame about grief that lingers. Like a stain on our clothes, it marks us as flawed, imperfect. To cling to grief, to desire its expression, is to be out of sync with modern life, where the hip do not get bogged down in mourning.</em></p>
    <p><em>Trust your gut and think for yourself.</em></p>
