    <h2>Forest Garden: Intentions</h2>
    <img src="garden1.jpeg" alt="snowy backyard" class="img">
    <p>This winter will be spent planning a forest garden for the backyard. Originally, I wanted to build a traditional garden with raised beds and neat rows of vegetables. After reading <em>Braiding Sweetgrass</em> and doing a bit of research online, planting a forest garden seems like the best option. A variety of plants (tall trees, low trees, shrubs, herbs, ground cover, roots, and vines) are planted to mimic a natural forest. They&apos;re more sustainable and require less upkeep.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I&apos;ll make a list of plants already living with us and the ones that I want transplanted here, and I&apos;ll head to a native plant nursery the next town over come spring. Meanwhile, I've been weeding in between snowfalls.</p>
    <p>I am also reminded of a passage from <em>Braiding Sweetgrass:</em></p>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
    <p>How do I show my girls I love them on a morning in June? I pick them wild strawberries. On a February afternoon we build snowmen and then sit by the fire. In March we make maple syrup. We pick violets in May and go swimming in July. On an August night we lay out blankets and watch meteor showers. In November, that great teacher the woodpile comes into our lives. That’s just the beginning. How do we show our children our love? Each in our own way by a shower of gifts and a heavy rain of lessons.</p>

    <p>Maybe it was the smell of ripe tomatoes, or the oriole singing, or that certain slant of light on a yellow afternoon and the beans hanging thick around me. It just came to me in a wash of happiness that made me laugh out loud, startling the chickadees who were picking at the sunflowers, raining black and white hulls on the ground. I knew it with a certainty as warm and clear as the September sunshine. The land loves us back. She loves us with beans and tomatoes, with roasting ears and blackberries and birdsongs. By a shower of gifts and a heavy rain of lessons. She provides for us and teaches us to provide for ourselves. That’s what good mothers do.</p>

    <p>Robin Wall Kimmerer's version of the honorable harvest - rules to follow while foraging:</p>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Know the ways of the ones who take care of you, so that you may take care of them.</p>
    <p>Introduce yourself. Be accountable as the one who comes asking for life. Ask permission before taking. Abide by the answer.</p>
    <p>Never take the first. Never take the last. Take only what you need.</p>
    <p>Take only that which is given.</p>
    <p>Never take more than half. Leave some for others. Harvest in a way that minimizes harm.</p>
    <p>Use it respectfully. Never waste what you have taken. Share.</p>
    <p>Give thanks for what you have been given.</p>
    <p>Give a gift, in reciprocity for what you have taken.</p>
    <p>Sustain the ones who sustain you and the earth will last forever.</p>
