    <h2>The Garden: </h2>
    <p>This winter will be spent planning a forest garden for the backyard. Originally, I wanted a traditional garden with raised garden beds and neat rows of vegetables. After reading <em>Braiding Sweetgrass</em> and doing a bit of research online, planting a forest garden seems like the best option. A variety of plants (tall trees, low trees, shrubs, herbs, ground cover, roots, and vines) are planted to mimic a natural forest. They&apos;re more sustainable and require less upkeep.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I&apos;ll make a list of plants already living with us and the ones that I want transplanted here, and I&apos;ll head to a native plant nursery the next town over come spring. For ground cover, I want to plant wild strawberries &mdash; and I also want to plant goldenrods and asters together. Robin Kimmerer was a big influence and I will follow her guidelines for an honorable harvest:</p>
